It is a Python3 projects using tkinter. Clothes Randomizer is an app for generating random outfit presets from downloaded PNGs.

Open "Clothes Randomizer.exe", that will innitiate new folder "Clothes". Put your clothes PNGs in it.
"Top" stands for hoodies and other warm or front clothes.
"Tishka" stands for T-Shirts etc.
"Pants" stands for any kind of pants you have.

That's it!

## Chalanges and learnings

I really got stuck on the path finding stuff, and different OS compatibility.
BUT the greatest thing human ever made - the Internet!!! I found all answers I desperately needed.
I learned how to work with os and tkinter python libraries. It was really fun experience.
I hope you enjoy my small project too.
